The goal of this repo is to show how to build a basic classifier using PyTorch.

The following elements are demonstated:
 - How to load a dataset
 - How to perform data augmentation
 - How to build a convolutional neural network
 - How to switch a network from training mode to eval mode for dropout deactivation
 - How to load the network on the GPU
 - How to train the network
 - How to evaluate a model
